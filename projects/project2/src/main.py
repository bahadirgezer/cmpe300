'''
    Use the mpi framework to distribute the work across multiple workers. It will be a master salve architecture.
    The master will be responsible for reading the csv file and distributing the work to the slaves. 
    The slaves will be responsible for counting the bigrams and returning the results to the master.
    The master will then merge the results and return the final result to the user.
